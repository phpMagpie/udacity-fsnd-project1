# Udacity FSND Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

This is my first project to be submitted as part of the [Udacity Full Stack Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

The base requirements of the project are to use the OOP principles we have learned so far within Python to output a static web page where users can see some of my favourite movies and watch their trailers.

## Basic Functionality
 1. Display some of my favourite movies allowing users to see the artwork and title
 2. When clicking on a movie, play the movie trailer

## Enhancements
Rather than write about each enhancement, I will commit them, along with fixes, to the repo so it's easier to see what was changed and why.

## Credits and Copyright
The vast majority of the base code for this was provided by Udactity during the tasks completed within this module of the course, including the [fresh_tomatoes.py](https://github.com/adarsh0806/ud036_StarterCode/blob/master/fresh_tomatoes.py) file.

The movie artwork was taken from third party sites and copyright remains with the image owners.  If I am infringing anyone's copyright, please let me know and I will act swiftly to remove the infringed material.
